 * If your singleton class is not using a lot of resources,

 *  Singleton classes are created for resources such as File System,
 *   Database connections etc and we should avoid the instantiation
 *    until unless client calls the getInstance method. 
 *    Also this method doesn¡¯t provide any options for exception handling.
